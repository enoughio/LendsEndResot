   Our story begins deep inside a 300-acre community-conserved forest, in the lap of nature we now call Sumiran Forest. Surrounded by clean air with an AQI often below 10, naturally alkaline water, and a thriving ecosystem of 300+ bird species and over 100 species of butterflies, we felt an urge to protect this land, not consume it. Land’s End – The Last Resort was born from this simple intention: to create a space where nature could breathe freely, and people could slow down enough to listen.

Built with ecological sensitivity and guided by the philosophy of living lightly, Land’s End is not a conventional luxury resort, but a slow, off-grid retreat shaped by the rhythm of the forest. Days here unfold through sunrise walks, earthy meals, quiet conversations, and long moments of stillness. Over time, the land began to share its stories, and so did the people who came. Today, Land’s End is a space for reflection, storytelling, learning, and retreats, hosting eco-festivals, gatherings, and personal journeys. This is where our road ended, and a deeper journey, inward and into nature, began.
